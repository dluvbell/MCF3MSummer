   theme-battle.js  —  the fighting world  (v1, 2026-08-06)

   What a theme file is:
     progress.js is theme-neutral. It knows how to run a challenge, count
     stars, track mastery and keep a streak, but it does not know what any
     of that is *called*. A theme file supplies the words.

   How it loads:
     progress.js reads mcf3m.v1.meta.theme, then loads theme-<id>.js from
     its own folder and waits for it before booting. Lesson files never
     mention this file, so adding a theme costs zero edits to the 22
     question files.

   What it may and may not change:
     may  — every label, every price, every description
     may  — which of the four items a world sells and what they are called
     not  — boss hp, par, reward, damage, mastery rules, star rates
   Balance stays in the engine on purpose. A reskin must never be able to
   make the mathematics easier by accident.

   Anything left out falls back to the engine's built-in battle defaults,
   so a half-written theme file still produces a working portal.
